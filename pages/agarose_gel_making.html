    <h3>Pouring a Standard 1% Agarose Gel:</h3>
    <p><u>Preparation:</u></p>
    <p>TAE Stock</p>
    <p>Agarose powder</p>
    <p>heating blocks/microwave, balance,measuring boat,flask,gel tray, gel
      comb, lab gloves,hand soap</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><u>Experiment Procedures:</u></p>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Measure 0.5 g of agarose.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Mix agarose powder with 50 mL 1xTAE in a microwavable flask.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Microwave (or via heating block) for 1-3 min until the agarose is
          completely dissolved (but do not overboil the solution, as some of the
          buffer will evaporate and thus alter the final percentage of agarose
          in the gel. )</p>
      </li>
      <p class="indent"> <em><strong>Note:</strong> Caution HOT! Be careful
          stirring, eruptive boiling can occur.</em> </p>
      <li>
        <p>Let agarose solution cool down to about 50°C (about when you can
          comfortably keep your hand on the flask), about 5 min.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> <em>(Optional)</em> Add ethidium bromide (EtBr) to a final
          concentration of approximately 0.2-0.5 μg/mL (usually about 2-3 μl of
          lab stock solution per 100 mL gel). EtBr binds to the DNA and allows
          you to visualize the DNA under ultraviolet (UV) light.</p>
      </li>
      <p class="indent"> <em><strong>Note:</strong> Caution EtBr is a known
          mutagen. Wear a lab coat, eye protection and gloves when working with
          this chemical.</em> </p>
      <li>
        <p>Pour the agarose into a gel tray with the well comb in place.</p>
      </li>
      <p class="indent"> <em><strong>Note:</strong> Pour slowly to avoid
          bubbles which will disrupt the gel. Any bubbles can be pushed away
          from the well comb or towards the sides/edges of the gel with a
          pipette tip.</em> </p>
      <li>Place newly poured gel at 4°C for 10-15 mins OR let sit at room
        temperature for 20-30 mins, until it has completely solidified.</li>
      <p class="indent"> <em><strong>Note:</strong> If you are in a hurry the
          gel can also be set more quickly if you place the gel tray at 4°C
          earlier so that it is already cold when the gel is poured into it.</em>
